\chapter{Set Theory}

\begin{dfnbox}{Empty Set, $\emptyset$}
	The \dfntxt{empty set}, denoted by $\emptyset$, is the set that contains no elements at all.
\end{dfnbox}

In other words, $x \notin \emptyset$ for all $x$.

\begin{dfnbox}{Subset, $A \subseteq B$}
	Let $A$ and $B$ be sets. We say that $A$ is a \dfntxt{subset} of $B$, denoted by $A \subseteq B$, if every element of $A$ is also an element of $B$, i.e., for all $x \in A$ we have $x \in B$.
\end{dfnbox}

\begin{dfnbox}{Superset, $A \supseteq B$}
	Let $A$ and $B$ be sets. We say that $A$ is a \dfntxt{superset} of $B$, denoted by $A \supseteq B$, if $B$ is a subset of $A$.
\end{dfnbox}

Note that the empty set is a subset of every set, and that every set is a superset of the empty set.

\begin{dfnbox}{Set Equality, $A = B$, $A \ne B$}
	Let $A$ and $B$ be sets. We say that $A$ and $B$ are \dfntxt{equal}, denoted by $A = B$, if $A \subseteq B$ and $B \subseteq A$. If this is not the case, then we write $A \ne B$ to denote that $A$ and $B$ are not equal.
\end{dfnbox}

\begin{dfnbox}{Proper Subset, $A \subsetneq B$}
	Let $A$ and $B$ be sets. We say that $A$ is a \dfntxt{proper subset} of $B$, denoted by $\subsetneq$, if $A \subseteq B$ and $A \ne B$.
\end{dfnbox}

\begin{dfnbox}{Proper Superset, $A \supsetneq B$}
	Let $A$ and $B$ be sets. We say that $A$ is a \dfntxt{proper superset} of $B$, denoted by $\supsetneq$, if $A \supseteq B$ and $A \ne B$.
\end{dfnbox}

\begin{dfnbox}{Power Set, $\powerset(A)$, $2^A$}
	Let $A$ be a set. The \dfntxt{power set} of $A$, denoted by $\powerset(A)$ or $2^A$, is the set containing all subsets of $A$.
\end{dfnbox}

Note that $\powerset(A)$ contains both the empty set $\emptyset$ and the set $A$ itself.

\begin{dfnbox}{Cartesian Product, $A \times B$}
	Let $A$ and $B$ be sets. The \dfntxt{Cartesian product} of $A$ and $B$, denoted by $A \times B$, is the set of all ordered pairs $(a, b)$ consisting of an element $a \in A$ followed by an element $b \in B$.
	\[ A \times B \coloneq \{ (a, b) : a \in A \text{ and } b \in B \} \]
\end{dfnbox}

\begin{dfnbox}{Relation, Binary Relation, Relates, $a \mathrel{R} b$, $a \mathrel{\cancel{R}} b$}
	Let $A$ and $B$ be sets. A \dfntxt{relation} between $A$ and $B$, also known as a \dfntxt{binary relation} between $A$ and $B$, is a subset $R \subseteq A \times B$ of their Cartesian product.

	Given $a \in A$ and $b \in B$, we write $a \mathrel{R} b$ to denote that  $(a, b) \in R$. If this is the case, then we say that $R$ \dfntxt{relates} $a$ to $b$. Similarly, we write $a \mathrel{\cancel{R}} b$ to denote that $(a, b) \notin R$.

	If $A = B$, then instead of saying that $R$ is a relation \textit{between} $A$ and $A$, we simply say that $R$ is a binary relation \textit{on} $A$.
\end{dfnbox}

For example, the less-than relation $<$ is a binary relation on the set $\N$ of natural numbers. We write $3 < 4$ to indicate that the ordered pair $(3, 4) \in \N \times \N$ is an element of the relation $<$.

\begin{dfnbox}{Function, Maps, Domain, Codomain, $f: A \to B$, $f(x)$}
	Let $A$ and $B$ be sets. A \dfntxt{function} from $A$ to $B$ is a binary relation $f \subseteq A \times B$ between $A$ and $B$ that has the following property: for each $x \in A$, there exists a unique $y \in B$ such that $x \mathrel{f} y$. Instead of the word ``relates,'' we say that the function $f$ \dfntxt{maps} $x$ to $y$. We call the set $A$ the \dfntxt{domain} of $f$, and we call $B$ the \dfntxt{codomain} of $f$.

	We write $f: A \to B$ to denote that $f$ is a function from $A$ to $B$, and given $x \in A$, we write $f(x)$ to denote the unique element of $B$ that is related to $x$ by $f$.
\end{dfnbox}

\begin{dfnbox}{Injective Function, One-to-one Function, Injection, $f: A \injto B$}
	Let $A$ and $B$ be sets. A function $f: A \to B$ is \dfntxt{injective}, or \dfntxt{one-to-one}, or an \dfntxt{injection}, if no two distinct elements of $A$ are mapped to the same element of $B$ by $f$.
	\[ \forall x, y \in A : x \ne y \implies f(x) \ne f(y) \]
	We write $f: A \injto B$ to denote that $f$ is an injective function from $A$ to $B$.
\end{dfnbox}

\begin{dfnbox}{Surjective Function, Onto Function, Surjection, $f: A \surjto B$}
	Let $A$ and $B$ be sets. A function $f: A \to B$ is \dfntxt{surjective}, or \dfntxt{onto}, or a \dfntxt{surjection}, if every element of $B$ is mapped to by $f$.
	\[ \forall y \in B \ \exists x \in A : f(x) = y \]
	We write $f: A \surjto B$ to denote that $f$ is a surjective function from $A$ to $B$.
\end{dfnbox}

\begin{dfnbox}{Bijective Function, One-to-one Correspondence, Bijection, $f: A \bijto B$}
	Let $A$ and $B$ be sets. A function $f: A \to B$ is \dfntxt{bijective}, or a \dfntxt{one-to-one correspondence}, or a \dfntxt{bijection}, if $f$ is both injective and surjective. We write $f: A \bijto B$ to denote that $f$ is a bijective function from $A$ to $B$.
\end{dfnbox}

\begin{dfnbox}{Image, $f[S]$}
	Let $A$ and $B$ be sets. Given a function $f: A \to B$, the \dfntxt{image} of a subset $S \subseteq A$ under $f$, denoted by $f[S]$, is the set defined by
	\[ f[S] \coloneq \{ f(x) : x \in S \}. \]
\end{dfnbox}

In other words, $f[S]$ is the subset of $B$ containing all elements that $f$ maps to from $S$. For example, consider the function $f: \R \to \R$ defined by $f(x) \coloneq x^2$. The image of the interval $(-1, 1)$ under $f$ is the interval $f[(-1, 1)] = [0, 1)$.

\begin{dfnbox}{Inverse Image, Preimage, $f^{-1}[S]$}
	Let $A$ and $B$ be sets. Given a function $f: A \to B$, the \dfntxt{inverse image} or \dfntxt{preimage} of a subset $S \subseteq B$ under $f$, denoted by $f^{-1}[S]$, is the set defined by
	\[ f^{-1}[S] \coloneq \{ x \in A : f(x) \in S \}. \]
\end{dfnbox}

In other words, $f^{-1}[S]$ is the subset of $A$ containing all elements that map into $S$ under $f$. For example, consider the function $f: \R \to \R$ defined by $f(x) \coloneq x^2$. The inverse image of the interval $(1, 4)$ is the union of the two intervals $f^{-1}[(1, 4)] = (-2, -1) \cup (1, 2)$.

\begin{dfnbox}{Range}
	Let $A$ and $B$ be sets. The \dfntxt{range} of a function $f: A \to B$ is the image $f[A]$ of $A$ under $f$.
\end{dfnbox}

Note that a function is surjective if and only if its range equals its codomain.

\begin{dfnbox}{Identity Function, $\id_A$}
	Let $A$ be a set. The \dfntxt{identity function} on $A$ is the function $\id_A: A \to A$ defined by $\id_A(a) \coloneq a$ for all $a \in A$.
\end{dfnbox}

\begin{dfnbox}{Cartesian Product, $\prod_{i \in I} A_i$}
	Let $I$ be an index set, and let $\{ A_i \}_{i \in I}$ be an indexed family of sets. The \dfntxt{Cartesian product} of $\{ A_i \}_{i \in I}$, denoted by $\prod_{i \in I} A_i$, is the set of all functions $f: I \to \bigcup_{i \in I} A_i$ such that $f(i) \in A_i$ for all $i \in I$.
	\[ \prod_{i \in I} A_i \coloneq \left\{ f: I \to \bigcup_{i \in I} A_i \ \middle|\ \forall i \in I : f(i) \in A_i \right\} \]
\end{dfnbox}



\chapter{Topology}

\begin{dfnbox}{Topology}
	Let $X$ be a set. A \dfntxt{topology} on $X$ is a collection $T \subseteq \powerset(X)$ of subsets of $X$
\end{dfnbox}

\begin{dfnbox}{Metric, Distance Function}
	Let $X$ be a set. A \dfntxt{metric} on $X$, also known as a \dfntxt{distance function} on $X$, is a function $d: X \times X \to \R$ that satisfies the following requirements:
	\begin{boxitems}
		\item \dfntxt{Positive-definiteness}: $d(x, y) \ge 0$ for all $x, y \in X$, and $d(x, y) = 0$ if and only if $x = y$.
		\item \dfntxt{Symmetry}: $d(x, y) = d(y, x)$ for all $x, y \in X$.
		\item \dfntxt{Triangle inequality}: $d(x, z) \le d(x, y) + d(y, z)$ for all $x, y, z \in X$.
	\end{boxitems}
\end{dfnbox}

\begin{dfnbox}{Metric Space, Underlying Set, Point}
	A \dfntxt{metric space} is an ordered pair $(X, d)$ consisting of a set $X$, called the \dfntxt{underlying set} of the metric space, and a metric $d$ on $X$. The elements of $X$ are called the \dfntxt{points} of the metric space $(X, d)$.
\end{dfnbox}

\begin{dfnbox}{Continuity}
	Let $(X, d_X)$ and $(Y, d_Y)$ be metric spaces. A function $f: X \to Y$ is \dfntxt{continuous} at a point $x_0 \in X$ if, for every $\epsilon > 0$, there exists $\delta > 0$, such that for all $x \in X$, if $d_X(x, x_0) < \delta$, then $d_Y(f(x), f(x_0)) < \epsilon$.
\end{dfnbox}

\begin{dfnbox}{Neighborhood}
Let $(X, T)$ be a topological space, and let $x \in X$. A subset $A \subseteq X$ is a \dfntxt{neighborhood} of $x$ if there exists an open set $U \in T$ such that $x \in U$ and $U \subseteq A$.
\end{dfnbox}



\chapter{Group Theory}

\begin{dfnbox}{Group}
	A \dfntxt{group} is an algebraic structure $\alg{G; 1, {}^{-1}, \cdot}$ consisting of:
	\begin{boxitems}
		\item a set $G$, called the \dfntxt{underlying set};
		\item a distinguished element $1 \in G$, called the \dfntxt{identity element};
		\item a unary operation ${}^{-1}: G \to G$, written as $x \mapsto x^{-1}$, called \dfntxt{inversion};
		\item a binary operation $\cdot: G \times G \to G$, written as $(x, y) \mapsto x \cdot y$, called the \dfntxt{group operation} or \dfntxt{group product};
	\end{boxitems}
	satisfying the following requirements:
	\begin{boxitems}
		\item \dfntxt{Associative property}: $(x \cdot y) \cdot z = x \cdot (y \cdot z)$ for all $x, y, z \in G$.
		\item \dfntxt{Identity property}: $1 \cdot x = x \cdot 1 = x$ for all $x \in G$.
		\item \dfntxt{Inverse property}: $x \cdot x^{-1} = x^{-1} \cdot x = 1$ for all $x \in G$.
	\end{boxitems}
\end{dfnbox}

\begin{dfnbox}{Abelian Group}
	An \dfntxt{abelian group} is a group $\alg{G; 1, {}^{-1}, \cdot}$ that satisfies the following additional requirement:
	\begin{boxitems}
		\item \dfntxt{Commutative property}: $x \cdot y = y \cdot x$ for all $x, y \in G$.
	\end{boxitems}
\end{dfnbox}



\chapter{Ring Theory}

In this chapter, we introduce a new class of algebraic structures, called rngs and rings, whose study is collectively called \dfntxt{ring theory}. Rngs and rings are more complicated than groups because their definition involves not one, but two binary operations.

\begin{dfnbox}{Rng}
	A \dfntxt{rng} (pronounced as ``\textit{rung}'') is an algebraic structure $\alg{R; 0, -, +, \cdot}$ consisting of:
	\begin{boxitems}
		\item a set $R$, called the \dfntxt{underlying set};
		\item a distinguished element $0 \in R$, called the \dfntxt{zero element};
		\item a unary operation $-: R \to R$, written as $x \mapsto -x$, called \dfntxt{negation};
		\item a binary operation $+: R \times R \to R$, written as $(x, y) \mapsto x + y$, called \dfntxt{addition};
		\item a binary operation $\cdot: R \times R \to R$, written as $(x, y) \mapsto x \cdot y$, called \dfntxt{multiplication};
	\end{boxitems}
	satisfying the following requirements:
	\begin{boxitems}
		\item \dfntxt{Additive structure}: $\alg{R; 0, -, +}$ is an abelian group.
		\item \dfntxt{Associativity}: $(x \cdot y) \cdot z = x \cdot (y \cdot z)$ for all $x, y, z \in R$.
		\item \dfntxt{Left distributivity}: $x \cdot (y + z) = (x \cdot y) + (x \cdot z)$ for all $x, y, z \in R$.
		\item \dfntxt{Right distributivity}: $(x + y) \cdot z = (x \cdot z) + (y \cdot z)$ for all $x, y, z \in R$.
	\end{boxitems}
\end{dfnbox}

The key ingredient in the definition of a rng is \dfntxt{distributivity}, which establishes a link between two different binary operations. We begin our study of rngs by proving a simple (but important) result to demonstrate the utility of the distributive property.

\begin{thmbox}{Multiplying by Zero Yields Zero}
	\textbf{Theorem:} Let $\alg{R; 0, -, +, \cdot}$ be a rng. For any $x \in R$, we have $0 \cdot x = x \cdot 0 = 0$.
\tcblower
	\textit{Proof:} Let $x \in R$ be given. Because $0$ is the identity element of the abelian group $\langle R; 0, -, + \rangle$, we have $0 = 0 + 0$. Using left distributivity, it follows that $0 \cdot x = (0 + 0) \cdot x = (0 \cdot x) + (0 \cdot x)$, and by canceling one copy of $0 \cdot x$ on both sides, we conclude that $0 \cdot x = 0$. We similarly apply right distributivity to the expression $x \cdot 0 = x \cdot (0 + 0) = (x \cdot 0) + (x \cdot 0)$ to conclude that $x \cdot 0 = 0$.
\end{thmbox}

\begin{dfnbox}{Zero Rng, Trivial Rng}
	The \dfntxt{zero rng} or \dfntxt{trivial rng} is the rng $\alg{ \{0\}; 0, -, +, \cdot }$ whose underlying set is a singleton containing the distinguished element $0$, and whose operations are defined by $-0 = 0 + 0 = 0 \cdot 0 = 0$.
\end{dfnbox}

\begin{dfnbox}{Nonzero Rng, Nontrivial Rng}
	A rng is \dfntxt{nonzero} or \dfntxt{nontrivial} if its underlying set contains more than one element.
\end{dfnbox}

\begin{dfnbox}{Ring}
	A \dfntxt{ring} is an algebraic structure $\alg{R; 0, 1, -, +, \cdot}$ consisting of:
	\begin{boxitems}
		\item a set $R$, called the \dfntxt{underlying set};
		\item a distinguished element $0 \in R$, called the \dfntxt{zero element};
		\item a distinguished element $1 \in R$, called the \dfntxt{identity element};
		\item a unary operation $-: R \to R$, written as $x \mapsto -x$, called \dfntxt{negation};
		\item a binary operation $+: R \times R \to R$, written as $(x, y) \mapsto x + y$, called \dfntxt{addition};
		\item a binary operation $\cdot: R \times R \to R$, written as $(x, y) \mapsto x \cdot y$, called \dfntxt{multiplication};
	\end{boxitems}
	satisfying the following requirements:
	\begin{boxitems}
		\item \dfntxt{Rng structure}: $\alg{R; 0, -, +, \cdot}$ is a rng.
		\item \dfntxt{Identity}: $1 \cdot x = x \cdot 1 = x$ for all $x \in R$.
	\end{boxitems}
\end{dfnbox}

\begin{dfnbox}{Commutative Ring}
	A \dfntxt{commutative ring} is a ring $R$ that satisfies the following additional requirement:
	\begin{boxitems}
		\item \dfntxt{Commutativity}: $x \cdot y = y \cdot x$ for all $x, y \in R$.
	\end{boxitems}
\end{dfnbox}
